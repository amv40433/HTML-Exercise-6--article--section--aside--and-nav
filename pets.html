    But dogs arenâ€™t just companions; they are also working animals trained for a variety of important tasks. 
    Some dogs help with herding livestock, detecting explosives, assisting people with disabilities, and more.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Police and Military Dogs</h2>
<p class="text">Police and military dogs are trained to perform a wide range of tasks. 
    Police K9 units help catch criminals and search homes and vehicles for drugs. 
    At the U.S.-Mexico and U.S.-Canada borders, dogs assist in catching smugglers. 
    Military dogs are trained to locate explosives and protect troops. In addition to law enforcement, these dogs can help locate lost people or even deceased individuals. 
    Some popular breeds for these roles include:</p>
    <ul class="list">  
        <li>German Shepherds</li>
        <li>Belgian Malinois</li>
        <li>Labrador Retrievers</li>

    Farmers, ranchers, and hunters often rely on dogs for daily tasks. 
    Working dogs can herd and protect livestock, retrieve game, or pull sleds in arctic regions. 
    Some popular breeds for these jobs include:</p>
    <ul class="list">  
        <li>Border Collies</li>

<h2 class="h2">Service Dogs</h2>
<p class="text">Service dogs are trained to assist individuals with disabilities or medical conditions.

    Emotional support animals also provide companionship and comfort, though they do not require the same specialized training.

<h2 class="h2">Companions</h2>

    Their loyalty, affection, and playful nature make them lifelong friends and a source of joy in countless households.</p>
